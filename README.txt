Materialize Accordions allows you to add a simple accordion with titles and body text via a shortcode.


== Description ==

This plugin allows you to add a collapsible accordion with a title and body text via shortcode on any page or post. It is based off the Materialize CSS framework. The interface is simple allowing you to sort sections around easily. It is fully responsive and mobile friendly and allows for keyboard accessibility. This plugin works with the Classic editor or the Gutenberg shortcode block and should have no conflicts with other plugins. For more options in the settings and support, please get the <a href="https://cool-wp-plugins.vercel.app">PRO version</a>. 

If you'd like to see a demo of the accordions, please go <a href="https://materialize-plugins.github.io/demo">here</a>. 

Note: Installing and activating the PRO version will not affect any accordions already published; they will still be there. The free version will automatically be deactivated and you can delete it afterwards.
